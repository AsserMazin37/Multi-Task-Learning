# Multi-Task-Learning

[UTKFace dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jangedoo/utkface-new) is a large-scale face dataset consisting of over 20,000 images. The images cover a wide range of ages and races and include both males and females. Using this dataset, I will be attempting to create a Multi-Task Learning CNN model to predict the age, gender and ethnicity of an individual.

Results achieved with my approach for now are:
- MAE for Age: 6.9978
- Gender Accuracy: 0.9016
- Ethnicity Accuracy: 0.8110
